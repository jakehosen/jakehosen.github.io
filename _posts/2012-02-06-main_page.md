title: About My Research

<img align="left" src="./files/jake_photo.jpg" height="300" style="margin:10px 10px"> As a freshwater scientist studying microbial ecology and carbon biogeochemistry, I use ecological principles to link microbes to macro-scale environmental processes. My research of inland waters uses cutting-edge research tools and computational approaches to investigate fundamental ecological questions. Ecological theory offers a rich framework for ecosystem science: now we have the equipment and analytical power to capture complexity in natural systems that was previously impossible. By coupling these data with modern informatics, I build comprehensive models that use ideas from across disciplines to track the flow of resources through the environment.
